# Noise texture generator

I was annoyed at the fact that after a couple of mintues of searching
the internet for a decent CC0 random noise image, I could not find
any. So I decided to make some myself, and it turned out to be
embarassingly simple (in large part due to the
[Juicy.Pixels](https://github.com/Twinside/Juicy.Pixels) and
[mwc-random](https://github.com/bos/mwc-random) libraries).
